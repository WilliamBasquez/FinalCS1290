Max Length of pair chain

1)max_len_chain(n) = max_len_chain(n-1) + max_len_chain(n-2) + max_len_chain(n-3) + .... + max_len_chain(1)
  n = number of pairs, it stops at one because the maximum length of a single pair is its length
  
2)By knowing how many combinations are possible, and most important, knowing how many combinations are valid, we can reuse that information into future possible incomes. 
  For example, by having a list of size 1, the longest possible chain is itself; with a size 2, the longest possible solution is a pair by itself, or the combination of those 2 chains (if possible), and this keeps going on and on until we reach n, the original problem.
  By trying all possible combinations and their outcomes, when we are presented with an option that has already been calculated up to a certain point, we will be able to retreive it from another previously created list keeping this information. For instance, if we have 3 pairs
  the max possible chain is 3, and if we know that 1+2 is not valid but 2+1 is, we store this information, and then we can just check a possible answer with a new input, and compute if there are any solutions by placing this third option in any position, and if this is false for 3,2,1 but true for 2,1,3
  then we return 3, otherwise if it's still not possible, we just return the previous max, 2.
